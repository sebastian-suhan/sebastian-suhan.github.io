        The Misfits are an American punk rock band often recognized as the progenitors
         of the horror punk subgenre, blending punk and other musical influences with horror film themes and imagery. 
         The group was founded in 1977 in Lodi, New Jersey, by vocalist, songwriter and keyboardist Glenn Danzig, and drummer Manny Mart√≠nez. 
         Jerry Only joined on bass guitar shortly after. Over the next six years, membership would change frequently with Danzig and Only the only consistent members. 
         During this time period, they released several EPs and singles, and with Only's brother Doyle as guitarist, the albums Walk Among Us (1982) and Earth A.D./Wolfs Blood (1983), both considered touchstones of the early-1980s hardcore punk movement. 
         The band has gone through many lineup changes over the years, with bassist Jerry Only being the only constant member in the group.
